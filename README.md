## Overview

### Chrony Puppet Module

Manage chrony time daemon on Archlinux and Redhat

## Module Description

The Chrony module handles running chrony in Archlinux and Redhat systems
with systemd.

## Setup

### What chrony affects

- chrony package.
- chrony configuration file.
- chrony key file.
- chrony service.

### Requirements

Please review `metadata.json` for a list of requirements.

The DNS Service records feature requires the `dig` command to be installed on the target system.

### Beginning with chrony

`include 'chrony'` is all you need to get it running. If you
wish to pass in parameters like which servers to use
then you can use:

```puppet
class { 'chrony':
  servers => ['ntp1.corp.com', 'ntp2.corp.com' ],
}
```

## Usage

All interaction with the chrony module can be done through
the main chrony class.

### I just want chrony, what's the minimum I need?

```puppet
include 'chrony'
```

### I just want to tweak the servers, nothing else

```puppet
class { 'chrony':
  servers => [ 'ntp1.corp.com', 'ntp2.corp.com', ],
}
```

### I'd like to make sure a secret password is used for chronyc

```puppet
class { 'chrony':
  servers         => [ 'ntp1.corp.com', 'ntp2.corp.com', ],
  chrony_password => 'secret_password',
}
```

### I'd like to use NTP authentication

```puppet
class { 'chrony':
  keys    => ['25 SHA1 HEX:1dc764e0791b11fa67efc7ecbc4b0d73f68a070c'],
  servers => {
    'ntp1.corp.com' => ['key 25', 'iburst'],
    'ntp2.corp.com' => ['key 25', 'iburst'],
  },
}
```

### I'd like chronyd to auto generate a command key at startup

```puppet
class { 'chrony':
   chrony_password    => 'unset',
   config_keys_manage => false,
}
```

### Allow some hosts

```puppet
class { 'chrony':
  queryhosts  => [ '192.168/16', ],
}
```

### How to configure leap second

```puppet
class { 'chrony':
  leapsecmode  => 'slew',
  smoothtime   => '400 0.001 leaponly',
  maxslewrate  => 1000.0
}
```

### Enable chrony-wait.service

RedHat and Suse provide a default disabled `chrony-wait.service` to block the `time-sync.target`
until node is synchronised.

To enable it:

```puppet
class { 'chrony':
  wait_enable => true,
  wait_ensure => true,
}
```

### Use DNS Service records for dynamic NTP configuration

You can configure chrony to use DNS Service records for dynamic NTP server discovery.
This feature uses chrony's native `sourcedir` functionality combined with DNS SRV queries
to automatically discover and configure NTP servers:

```puppet
class { 'chrony':
  dnssrv_records => [
    '_ntp._udp.example.com',
    '_ntp._udp.backup.example.com',
  ],
}
```

The DNS SRV records are queried periodically (every 30 minutes by default via systemd timer), and
the discovered servers are written to `.sources` files in `/var/run/chrony-dnssrv` (by default).
Chrony automatically reloads these sources without requiring a service restart.

## Reference

Reference documentation for the chrony module is generated using
[puppet-strings](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/puppet_strings.html) and
available in [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md)

## Limitations

See `metadata.json` for supported and tested operating systems.
